Dear Developers,

I created an XRP account in 2014, but I was unaware that January 2018 would be the last time I could access it. At that time, XRP was at its peak, and now it is falling. I attempted to transfer my XRP to USDT, but my account is in ReadOnly status.

After conducting extensive research, I discovered that Ripple had notified me in 2018 to set up a regular key. Later, I saw a message indicating that Ripple applied a regular key to accounts that had not been set up.

In this situation, I believe Ripple should provide users with a regular key and a seed. However, they did not provide a seed when they created my regular key.

I currently have 500,000 XRP in my account, I am looking forward to your help and I am willing to offer a 10% fee for your services.

Thank you.
